# Applets Programs  

## Overview  
This repository contains Java Applet programs that demonstrate various functionalities using **Java Applets**. Applets are small Java applications that can run inside a web browser or an applet viewer.  

## Contents  
The repository includes different **Java Applet** programs covering:  
- Basic applet structure  
- Graphics and animations  
- Event handling  
- User interactions (mouse, keyboard)  
- Form handling with buttons, text fields, etc.  

## Prerequisites  
To run the Java Applet programs, you need:  
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)** installed  
- An **IDE** like Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ IDEA (optional)  
- **Applet Viewer** (for running applets)  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sruthiramya/Applets-programs.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Compile the Java file:  
   ```sh
   javac Filename.java
   ```  
4. Run the applet using the Applet Viewer:  
   ```sh
   appletviewer Filename.html
   ```  

## Future Enhancements  
- Convert applets into standalone GUI applications using **Swing/JavaFX**  
- Add documentation and comments for better understanding
